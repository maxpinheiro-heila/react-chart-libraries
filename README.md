# React Chart Library Investigation

A visualization of the chart libraries investigated for [CORE 679](https://heilatech.atlassian.net/browse/CORE-679). The app is separated into several pages:
- Chart Comparison: the initial investigation of 6 chart libraries (including the current library), displaying all charts simutaneously
- Revised Charts: the secondary investigation, which narrowed down the chart options and sought to improve the chart design
- Recharts Demo: a deeper investigation into the capabilities of the Recharts library

A more formal report on the chart libraries can be found [here](https://heilatech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2087616548/ReactJS+Chart+libraries).
